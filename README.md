# CS-305---Software-Security Module Eight Journal

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in personalized financial plansfor clients. Their financial plans encompass areas such as savings, retirement,investments, and insurance. In collaboration with Global Rain, they are aiming tomodernize their operations, including the use of a RESTful web applicationprogramming interface (API). The primary concern for Artemis Financial is to enhancethe security of their operations. They seek Global Rain's expertise to identify potentialsecurity vulnerabilities within their web-based software application. The objective is tocomprehensively assess the application for potential threats and vulnerabilities andsubsequently create a vulnerability assessment report. This report will serve as aroadmap for implementing security measures that effectively mitigate any identifiedvulnerabilities and safeguard Artemis Financial's software and sensitive financial datafrom external threats.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

During the process of identifying security vulnerabilities in the client's software, Ieffectively employed Maven to scan for potential vulnerabilities. This allowed me toleverage automated tools to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the software'sdependencies and identify any known security issues.In addition to utilizing Maven, I conducted meticulous manual code reviews, whichencompassed a thorough examination of the software's codebase, including the APIbuilt into the program. This hands-on approach enabled me to identify potential entrypoints for vulnerabilities, analyze coding patterns, and pinpoint any non-trivial securityweaknesses that might not be detected by automated tools.Combining the power of Maven's automated vulnerability scanning with manual codereviews ensured a comprehensive assessment. While automated tools can efficientlyidentify known vulnerabilities, manual reviews provide the context to uncover morenuanced security issues that might arise from custom code or unique usage scenarios.By integrating both approaches, I maximized the likelihood of identifying a wide range ofsecurity vulnerabilities, from common exploits to more intricate and application-specific weaknesses. This hybrid approach allowed me to provide the client with a detailedvulnerability assessment report that offers a holistic view of potential threats, therebyguiding effective mitigation strategies.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

The vulnerability assessment process presented both challenges and valuable learning opportunities. One particular aspect that proved challenging was devising effective solutions to address the vulnerabilities that were identified. While the assessmenthighlighted potential security weaknesses, determining the most suitable and efficientways to mitigate these vulnerabilities required careful consideration and expertise.Some vulnerabilities might not have straightforward fixes, necessitating creativeproblem-solving and a deep understanding of the software's architecture.Furthermore, dealing with instances where the automated assessment tools returnedfalse results posed a unique challenge. False positives can lead to unnecessaryresource allocation and hinder the overall vulnerability mitigation process. Distinguishinggenuine vulnerabilities from false alarms required a discerning eye and the ability tocritically evaluate the context and details of each flagged issue.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Ensuring both functionality and security in the code and software application was ameticulous process. To achieve this, I employed a multifaceted approach that involvedrigorous testing and validation.To ensure functionality, I initially executed the software to identify any runtime errors oranomalies that might affect its performance. By running the program and simulatingreal-world scenarios, I could confirm that the software met its intended requirementsand operated as expected.For security, after implementing SHA256 encryption, I incorporated a checksumgeneration process. This involved creating a checksum after the encryption process. Bychecking the checksum, I could ascertain whether the encryption function functioned asintended and whether the data remained unchanged throughout the encryption anddecryption processes. This step provided a way to verify that the encryption did notintroduce data corruption or inconsistencies.After refactoring the code, I conducted thorough regression testing. This involvedrerunning the full suite of functional and security tests on the refactored codebase todetect any new vulnerabilities that might have emerged during the code changes. Bycomparing the results of these tests with the pre-refactoring results, I could identify anydiscrepancies or potential vulnerabilities introduced by the code changes

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I would have several valuable examples to showcase my skills,knowledge, and experience to future employers:
1.Vulnerability Assessment Report: I can present the vulnerability assessmentreport that I created for Artemis Financial's software application. This reportwould demonstrate my ability to identify and analyze security vulnerabilities,propose mitigation strategies, and communicate findings effectively. It showcasesmy proficiency in understanding security risks and formulating actionablesolutions. 2.Code Refactoring and Security Enhancements: I can showcase the originalcodebase and the refactored version that includes security enhancements. Bycomparing the two versions, I can highlight my coding skills in implementingsecure practices, such as encryption and checksum verification, to protectsensitive data and fortify the software against potential threats. 3.Maven Integration: I can discuss my utilization of Maven for vulnerabilitydetection. Explaining how I leveraged this tool to scan for known vulnerabilities inthe software's dependencies showcases my ability to employ moderndevelopment tools to enhance security practices and reduce potential risks. 4.Testing and Validation Artifacts: I can provide examples of test plans, test cases,and testing results used to validate the functionality and security of the softwareapplication. These artifacts showcase my systematic approach to testing and mydedication to ensuring the software's reliability and security. 5.Documentation and Communication: I can present any documentation, such asdesign documents, diagrams, and technical explanations, that I created toeffectively communicate security measures and enhancements to stakeholders.This highlights my ability to articulate complex technical concepts and solutionsin a clear and understandable manner
